Final Fantasy Tactics: Ivalice Chronicles ~ Story Events only

Play on Tactician difficulty 

Only Story Battles are to be fought in. (Optional Story Battles are okay to fight in.)

Must always choose the choice of saving dialogue in battles.

If for some reason you are in a random battle that is not a story battle, escape said battle until you reached a story battle.

If game over is achieved restart from beginning, fresh file.

At the start of every chapter you may shop at the first city you visit or start at. After leaving the city you may no longer shop at any Outfitter until the next chapter. ~ Poaching is okay but cannot go out of your way to collect it, you must land on a city with the Poachers' Den on the way to a story event.

    Cities in question.
    Chapter 1: Gariland
    Chapter 2: Dorter Trade City
    Chapter 3: Dorter Trade City
    Chapter 4: Riovanes Castle

Free to visit the Tavern for lore and Errands 

Reminder! You must land on that city on the way to a story event otherwise they cannot be retrieved! You're not allowed to go out of your way to retrieve them! 

The Player should exhaust all their once per revival methods to the best of their abilities 

Exception: Winning the battle does not equal a revival method in the event it happens, can be encouraged

Allies with a death counter can only be revived once per revival method, example of allies without a death counter is Guests.

    Revival methods:
        Phoenix Down
        Raise
        Arise
        Reraise(S,H,N) (Per Method by Spell or Dragonheart or Nameless Song)

    If revived by Guest it is permitted as an exception
    Always allowed to be revived by the enemy

    No reraise equipment: 
        Angel's Ring
        Chantage

    Dragonheart reaction can only be used once, if it procs and the unit revives by using it at least once, after the battle
        they can no longer use that reaction for the rest of the game

    Bard Song Nameless Song can only be used if no character has died and is revived using its Reraise, upon its use 
        it can no longer be used for the entire game. So be careful!

If a unit has a chance of a killing blow on an enemy, and there are no other backlogs to pay attention to (reviving allies, killing other enemies, collecting crystals or chests), 
the unit must go for a killing blow unless the chances are less than 100, the player can choose not to do so.

The Player cannot stall the battle, they must quickly end the battle as soon as they can. The player is not allowed to target their own allies if they can attack the enemy. There are exceptions to this rule, All Units are too far away from the final target to land a killing blow or damage them, the flood gate battle aka Fort Besselat Sluice.

All available units must be equally used in every battle, Ramza and Guests are exempted. When all units have been used once the player may choose from the pool of units not current in battle once again. 
    Please keep track of your units involvement. Otherwise you may chose the unit you wish to bring into battle, then after the battle they may not be selected when going into the next battle unless 
    all units have been used once already. So be careful of monster units!

Jobs are determined first by what is their current brave or faith numbers are at

    If Brave > Faith -> They start as Squire
    If Brave < Faith -> They start as Chemist

Then their next job is determined upon job level up after the battle ends. The new job that has the higher jp points will be automatically selected, if tied with jp then it is up to player to choose, players must also inspect if the unit have already prelearn any skills, ignore the jp point requirement to learn the skill whatever has the most skills learn % is the priority job.

Exceptions: 
The Starting Six units, they retain their current jobs.

Alicia, Lavian, and Ladd, they retain their current jobs. Then the job inspection for Squire or Chemist for Alicia and Lavian
