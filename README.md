Final Fantasy Tactics: Ivalice Chronicles ~ Story Events only

1: Only Story Battles are the battles allowed to be fought in.

2: No further Shopping at the Outfitters except at the start of the chapter at the first city visited, you are free to enter and exit the Outfitters so long as you have not left the city ~ try to scavenge asap ~ Poaching is okay but cannot go out of your way to collect it, 
    must land on a city with the Poachers' Den on the way to a story event.

    Chapter 1: Gariland
    Chapter 2: Dorter Trade City
    Chapter 3: Dorter Trade City
    Chapter 4: Riovanes Castle


3: If for some reason in a random battle that is not a story event, restart until you reached a story event.

4: Players can chose the direction of their route to the Story Event if there is two or more ways to get there but should always be heading to the next story event.

5: Allies with a death counter can only be revived once per revival method, example of allies without a death counter is Guests.

    Revival methods:
        Phoenix Down
        Raise
        Arise
        Reraise(Spell or Dragonheart)

    If revived by Guest it is permitted as an exception, make use of their AI using Phoenix Down ;p
    Always allowed to be revived by the enemy

    No reraise equipment: 
        Angel's Ring
        Chantage

    Dragonheart reaction can only be used once, if it procs and the unit revives by using it at least once, 
        they can no longer after the battle use that reaction for the rest of the game

    Bard Song Nameless Song can only be used if no character dies and is revived using its Reraise, upon its use 
        it can no longer be used for the entire game. So be careful!

6: Must always choose the choice of saving dialogue in battles.

7: Free to visit the Tavern for lore and Errands(The only known method of sending units away to not have to use them in battle. Reminder!: You must land on that city on the way to a story 
    event otherwise they cannot be retrieved! You're not allowed to go out of your way to retrieve them!)

8: If a unit has a chance of a killing blow on an enemy, and there are no other backlogs to pay attention to (reviving allies, killing other enemies, collecting crystals or chests), 
the unit must go for a killing blow unless the chances are less than 100, the player can choose not to do so.

9: The Player cannot stall the battle, they must quickly end the battle as soon as they can. There are exceptions to this rule, All Units are too far away from the final target to land a killing 
    blow or damage them, the flood gate battle aka Fort Besselat Sluice.

10: All available units must be equally used in every battle, Ramza and Guests are exempted. When all units have been used once the player may choose from pool of units not current in battle again. 
    Please keep track of your units involvement. Otherwise you may chose the unit you wish to bring into battle, then after the battle they may not be selected when going into the next battle unless 
    all units have been used once already. So be careful of monster units!

11: Jobs are determined first by what is their current brave or faith numbers are at

    If Brave > Faith -> They start as Squire
    If Brave < Faith -> They start as Chemist


Then their next job is determined upon job level up. The new job that has the higher jp points will be automatically selected, if tied with jp then it is up to player choice, players must also inspect if they have already prelearn any skills, ignore the jp point requirement to learn the skill whatever has the most skills learn is the priority job. Exceptions are the Special Jobs.

Exceptions: 
The Starting Six units, they retain their current jobs.
